When we developed the course [Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/sml/) for engineering students at Uppsala University, we found no appropriate textbook, so we ended up writing our own.

The book will eventually be published by Cambridge University Press.

A draft of the book is available on this page. **We will keep a PDF of the book freely available also after publication.**
