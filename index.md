description: An upcoming textbook on the essentials of supervised machine learning

When we developed the course [Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/sml/) for engineering students at Uppsala University, we found no appropriate textbook, so we ended up writing our own. It will eventually be published by Cambridge University Press.

[Andreas Lindholm](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/andsv164/),
[Niklas Wahlström](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/nikwa778/),
[Fredrik Lindsten](https://liu.se/medarbetare/freli29), and
[Thomas B. Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/)

A draft of the book is available on this page. **We will keep a PDF of the book freely available also after publication.**
